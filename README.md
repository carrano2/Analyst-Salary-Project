# Analyst Salary Project

## Business Question(s):

What are the average salaries per skill level for Analyst jobs in the US? What is the average job salary I can reasonably expect as a data analyst as a result of my current skill level?

I will use my Excel, Python, and SQL skills to answer this question in two different ways.

## Application:

Due to my current skill level as a budding analyst I can reasonably expect a salary between 55k as an Entry Level BI Analyst and 73k a year as an Entry Level Data Analyst depending on which job I end up getting.  I am not qualified for Entry Level Financial Analyst position as I do not hold a degree in Finance nor am I qualified for a Entry Level Business Data Analyst role as I do not hold a degree in business.
